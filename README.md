# Surface-roughness-measuring

Working with Prof. Gerald Sussman to utilize Computer Vision transforms to model the brainâ€™s behavior. The brain collects
sensory input from all over the body and sends it to the hypothalamus to identify objects.

Aim to build a machine that collects this data using various mechanical sensors to create a cohesive object map by clustering.

Successfully detects surface roughness, currently focusing on finding frictional coefficient through analyzing normal force
and robot motor force.
